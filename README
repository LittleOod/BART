Brain Analysis in Real Time - BART

This software package analyzes neuroscientific fMRI data in real-time.
It can be used for Neurofeedback experiments.
Additionally, it contains it's own stimulus environment that can be used either for conventional paradigms or newly for adapted paradigms. These paradigms can be triggered from an external modality. The paradigm adaptation is immediately fed into the design matrix for the fMRI data analysis.
